# Hasselblad X2D II QEMU DevKit

**A native Windows workbench for exploring the original X2D II interface and developing guest apps.**

## From firmware to a running UI

1. Download **X2DII-DevKit-Windows-x64.zip** from Releases, extract it, and double-click **X2DII-DevKit.exe**. Python, Qt and WSL are not required on your computer.
2. Download a supported **X2D II 100C `.cim`** from Hasselblad. Drop it into the workbench or click the import area.
3. Click **Start original UI**. On first use, review the Android SDK license and approve runtime setup. The app downloads and verifies its runtime, then boots the guest.
4. Click to tap, drag to swipe. **Stop** shuts down the owned QEMU process. The next launch uses your cached firmware and runtime, offline.

Initial runtime download: approximately **615 MB**. Allow **8 GB free disk space**, a Windows x64 computer, and preferably at least 8 GB RAM. Runtime files are extracted into your user profile; no administrator privileges or system-wide installation is needed.

## What you get

- Drag-and-drop firmware import, SHA-256 validation and a local firmware library.
- Original firmware UI, streamed directly from a minimal Wayland compositor in QEMU.
- Start/stop controls, correctly scaled mouse touch input and PNG screenshots.
- English / Simplified Chinese; system / light / dark themes; Iris / Blue / Leaf accents.
- A guest console, persistent logs and an editable **hello.c** development workspace.
- **Build app → Run app** using an installed Android NDK; no NDK is needed to run the original UI.
- Disposable system writes and a separate data disk per imported firmware.

## Compatibility and limits

| Item | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Windows x64 host | Supported; portable Qt application |
| X2D II 1.2.7.16 | Original UI, menu navigation and Display submenu verified |
| X2D II 1.3.16.2 | See [verification record](docs/VERIFICATION.md) |
| Other firmware | Rejected until its exact package is validated |
| Rendering | QEMU TCG + Qt Quick software backend |
| Hardware acceleration | Not implemented for this ARM64 guest on x86-64 Windows |
| Capture, ISP, AF, lens, USB camera, real storage | Not emulated |
| Physical camera installation / firmware flashing | Not provided |

This runs the **original camera user interface in an Android ARM64 development guest**, with simulated camera services. It does not boot the camera's original kernel or reproduce the complete camera hardware. UI responsiveness varies with the host CPU. Camera values are mocked and some actions are intentionally unsupported.

A local development copy changes two embedded QML visibility bindings so images can render without the camera GPU. The original executable is retained, executable instructions are not patched, and no modified firmware is written back to the `.cim` file. See [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Develop an app

1. Import and select firmware.
2. Open **Development → Open development workspace**.
3. Edit `hello.c` in your editor.
4. Select your [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads) folder (**r27 tested**).
5. Stop any running guest, click **Build app**, then **Run app**.

The example is an Android/Bionic ARM64 `wl_shm` client. It runs in its own guest session; stop it and start Original UI to return. The firmware payload is read-only while QEMU runs, so stop before rebuilding. Custom Qt guest applications require a compatible Android ARM64 Qt toolchain, which is not included. A Windows Qt executable cannot run inside this guest.

## Run from source

Install Python **3.11+**, clone the repository, and double-click `Launch.cmd`. It creates a local virtual environment and installs dependencies on the first run.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/derrickyau9/Hasselblad-X2D-II-QEMU-DevKit.git
cd Hasselblad-X2D-II-QEMU-DevKit
.\Launch.cmd
```

For contributors:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
.\.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -q
.\.venv\Scripts\python run_app.py
.\.venv\Scripts\python scripts/build.py
```

Data lives in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\X2DII-DevKit`. Set `X2DII_DEVKIT_HOME` or pass `--home <directory>` for a different location. Avoid commas in runtime/data paths. Firmware files, extracted assets, runtime downloads, logs and user workspaces are excluded from Git.
